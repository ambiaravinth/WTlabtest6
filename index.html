        <DIV><p>Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, 
            odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent 
            of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which 
            it acts as a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of life, even though 
            it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula H2O, indicates 
            that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by 
            covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.[2] 
            "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature 
            and pressure.</p></DIV>
